The *Linero Tech Community* aims to be a centralized place where students can ask questions, find answers, and share experiences. Think of it as an all-in-one knowledge base, support forum, resource hub, and inspiration station.

The goal is to provide our students with the necessary support during their educational journey. Regardless of how big or small your challenge or question is, all resources and information will be available in this community in a true open-source fashion.
